### [Logic] Use Self-Explanatory Names
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Problem:** Abbreviated or unclear variable/function names reduce code readability (e.g., `del`, `deps`, `fetchFn`)
**Solution:** Use full descriptive names: `deleteSession`, `dependencies`, `fetchFunction`. Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood (e.g., `id`, `url`)
**Prevention:** Before naming, ask "Would a new team member understand this without context?" Prefer clarity over brevity
