# Version Bump on Commit

## Rule

Before creating any git commit, bump the version in `package.json`:

1. **Analyze changes** to determine version type:
   - **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, API changes, major refactors
   - **Minor** (0.x.0): New features, non-breaking additions
   - **Patch** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, documentation, small improvements

2. **When unsure**, always ask:
   > "Should this be a **minor** or **major** version bump? Changes include: [brief summary]"

3. **Update version** in `package.json` before committing

## Commit Flow

1. Analyze staged changes
2. Determine/ask version bump type
3. Update `package.json` version
4. Include version bump in the commit
