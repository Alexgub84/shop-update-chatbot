# Plan & Documentation Management

## Always Follow the Plan

1. **Before starting work**: Read `PLAN.md` to understand current progress and next steps
2. **During work**: Follow the plan's architecture and structure
3. **After completing a step**: Update `PLAN.md` immediately

## Updating PLAN.md

After completing each task:
- Move completed items from "In Progress" to "Completed" (mark with `[x]`)
- Move next items from "Pending" to "In Progress" (mark with `[ ]`)
- Update architecture section if implementation changed
- Add any new tasks discovered during implementation

## Handling New Instructions

When the user provides new instructions or requirements during work:

1. **Update PLAN.md**: Add new tasks to appropriate section (Pending/In Progress)
2. **Update basic-instructions.md**: If it changes core requirements or specifications
3. **Update messages/en.json**: If new bot messages are needed
4. **Update .env.example**: If new environment variables are added

## Source of Truth

- `PLAN.md` - Current progress and implementation plan
- `basic-instructions.md` - Full project requirements and specifications
- `messages/en.json` - All user-facing bot messages

Keep all documentation in sync with actual implementation.
