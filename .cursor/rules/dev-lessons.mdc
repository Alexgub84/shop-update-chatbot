# Dev Lessons Management

## When to Update DEV-LESSONS.md

After fixing any of these issues, add an entry to `DEV-LESSONS.md`:

- Bug fixes (especially non-obvious ones)
- Configuration mistakes
- Dependency issues
- Environment problems
- Architecture decisions that failed
- Performance issues discovered
- Security vulnerabilities found

## Entry Format

```markdown
### [Category] Short Title
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Problem:** One sentence describing what went wrong
**Solution:** One sentence describing the fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid this in the future (optional)
```

## Categories

- `Config` - Environment, settings, configuration issues
- `Deps` - Package, dependency, version problems
- `Logic` - Code logic bugs
- `Types` - TypeScript type errors
- `Async` - Promise, async/await issues
- `Test` - Testing-related problems
- `Infra` - Docker, deployment, CI/CD issues

## Rules

1. Keep entries concise (3-4 lines max)
2. Focus on the root cause, not symptoms
3. Add entry immediately after fixing the issue
4. Don't duplicate existing entries - check first
